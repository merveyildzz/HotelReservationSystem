# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System – C++ Console Project
This is a C++ based hotel reservation system designed to manage **check-in** and **check-out** operations with strict validation controls. The project simulates real-life scenarios such as date validations, room availability, and logical error handling.

## ✨ Features

🔹 **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)** – Modular structure using a `Validation` class  
🔹 **Date Validations** – Accurate checks for day, month, year, and leap years  
🔹 **User Input Control** – Verifies number ranges and formats  
🔹 **Error Handling** – Guides the user with clear messages for invalid entries  
🔹 **Real-World Logic** – Calculates stay duration and ensures valid reservations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- OOP Principles
- Console I/O
- Custom Validation Functions

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was developed to practice core C++ skills including OOP, user input handling, and logical programming. It reflects real-world thinking in designing a reliable reservation system.
